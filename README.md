My name is Alex and I am a science student majoring in Biochemistry and Pharmacology at Monash University.

My career goals are to get my foot through the door in this new and exciting field of Fintech.

I chose Fintech as a career path firstly because it is the future. Secondly, because I am genuinely fascinated by how this field will impact the finance sector in the future.
